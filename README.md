# SFERA

This repository regroups several modules to calibrate a dual-back-to-back fisheye event camera and operates event-based target tracking of fast moving objects. This repository will be updated with new branch at each new release of the framework.

The source code of the present version was also used to generate the results of our ICRA25 paper "A new Stereo Fisheye Event Camera for Fast Drone Detection and Tracking".
